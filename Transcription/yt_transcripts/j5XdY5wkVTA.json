changed.", "323.355": "But if I ask you about tomorrow,\nwhat would you like for lunch,", "325.98": "you tell me a choice, you want\napples rather than bananas.", "328.62": "And then tomorrow, you show up\nand nothing else has changed", "331.08": "and you say, now,\nI want bananas.", "332.46": "Well then, your\npreferences are not stable.", "335.28": "That's one assumption, yes.", "336.433": "What else do you have?", "337.35": "Yeah.", "338.01": "AUDIENCE: More broadly,\nthey're rational.", "340.315": "FRANK SCHILBACH: Yes.", "341.19": "And what does that mean?", "343.581": "AUDIENCE: They behaved\ndeterministically", "345.85": "to optimize some\nutility function.", "347.397": "FRANK SCHILBACH: Right, exactly.", "348.73": "So people essentially optimize\nsome utility function.", "351.75": "So we say here, people\nhave the utility function", "353.83": "and know what that is.", "355.08": "And you're sort of\nsaying they maximize it", "356.83": "to optimize in a certain way.", "358.22": "They don't make mistakes in\nthat maximization process.", "361.91": "So that's to say if you tell me\nyou like apples over bananas,", "366.88": "and then you choose bananas,\nwell then, something", "369.172": "is sort of going\nwrong in some ways", "370.63": "that we haven't\nfully understood.", "371.89": "It might be that you\nsort of like just", "373.473": "making mistakes that

yes.", "383.33": "So like usually in a lot of\nmodels all like this sort of--", "386.86": "the easiest model is a very\nnarrowly defined self-interest", "389.98": "is what people care\nabout themselves.", "391.9": "They care about\nwhat they consume", "394.03": "and not about what\nothers consume,", "395.59": "or what others think of them.", "398.21": "So sort of narrowly\ndefined

essentially,\nperfect self-control", "409.44": "usually is sort of one\nversion of putting that.", "412.003": "One version of putting that\nis in some sense sort of going", "414.42": "back to what you saying\nearlier is sort of", "416.17": "to say stable preferences.", "417.48": "If I'm telling you I'd\nlike to exercise tomorrow,", "420.09": "and that's my\npreference, tomorrow I'm", "422.67": "not going to be like, oh, yeah,\nactually, I changed my mind", "425.79": "and now I'm just watching\nmovies, or the like, right?", "428.19": "So that's the version of sort\nof preferences being stable.", "430.77": "But the inherent\nunderlying issue there", "433.02": "is like self-control problems\nin the sense of like,", "435.45": "if I like certain\nthings, or make", "437.1": "certain plans for the future,\nI have the self-control", "440.19": "to follow through\non those plans.", "441.682": "That's usually an assumption.", "442.89": "And that then shows up as\npreferences being stable.", "447.47": "What else?", "447.97": "Yeah.", "448.47": "AUDIENCE: They prefer\nconsumption today", "450.251": "than consumption tomorrow.", "451.334": "[INAUDIBLE]", "453.143": "FRANK SCHILBACH: Yeah.", "454.06": "So usually, there is\nlike a discount factor", "456.88": "in terms of how much you\nlike consumption today", "459.49": "versus consumption tomorrow.", "461.89": "That is usually in\nany economic model.", "463.9": "Usually, we think of like the\ndiscount factor being constant,", "467.35": "as like how you think\nabout today versus tomorrow", "469.51": "is the same as you think\nabout today versus in two", "472.06": "days from now, or like a year\nfrom now and a year and a day", "474.92": "from now.", "475.42": "So usually, there's a constant\ndiscount factor for the future.",

Risk aversion.", "490.26": "FRANK SCHILBACH:\nYes, risk aversion", "491.95": "in the sense of, I guess,\npeople are risk averse,", "496.26": "and people often sort of define\ntheir preferences over outcome.", "499.747": "So they have a utility function\nthat we tend to concave,", "502.08": "and the utility\nfunction is-- and we'll", "503.88": "get to this in a few lectures.", "506.2": "But the utility\nfunction is concave", "508.29": "and it's defined over outcome\nas opposed to over changes", "511.8": "of outcomes.", "512.49": "And that shows up usually\nas sort of like essentially",

SCHILBACH: Exactly.", "532.462": "So people essentially are\nperfect information processors.", "536.293": "You can call them Bayesians.", "537.46": "But essentially, it's\nsort of-- for those of you", "539.204": "know that-- it's sort of\ndid they use Bayes' rule,", "541.287": "essentially, which\nis to say if you gave", "543.28": "a statistician a problem\nhow to update information,", "546.94": "people are able to do\nthat in their heads.", "549.22": "And that's a pretty\nstark assumption.", "550.832": "But essentially, it's\nlike when you people have", "552.79": "certain information, standard\neconomics does not necessarily", "556.66": "assume that everybody has\nfull information in a sense", "559.05": "that everybody knows everything.", "560.74": "But if you give them\nsome information,", "563.03": "then they update their\nbeliefs accordingly, right?", "566.165": "So they-- essentially, they\noptimally use new information", "568.54": "and then form their beliefs,\ntheir posterior beliefs based", "570.957": "on having new information and\nwhat they believe previously,", "574.78": "their priors.", "575.95": "There's another\nassumption, usually,", "577.45": "and I sort of can\nactually sort of", "578.867": "put these out for you, which\nis, there's another assumption.", "582.88": "That is, people have no taste\nfor beliefs or information.", "586.36": "What do we mean by that?", "587.36": "We mean by that is,\nessentially, people", "589.03": "use information only\nto make decisions.", "591.8": "So if you tell me\nsomething about", "593.198": "like what's going\nto happen tomorrow,", "594.74": "or if you tell me something\nabout my health status,", "597.31": "or the like, I use that\nto make better decisions.", "600.32": "So if you tell me I'm sick,
